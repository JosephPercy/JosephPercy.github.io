          Let me clarify, I did not go viral or get famous from this, the title may be a little misleading. However, I did make it into a photography exhibition at the Valid World Hall in Barcelona, Spain and that is exciting enough for me. It was all possible because I finally put myself, and my photos, out there; something I have put off for a long time due to fear of rejection from the community. This is the short and somewhat uneventful story of my first time entering a photography contest online.

          For years I have loved photography. I got my first camera, a simple and not very able bridge camera, when I was fifteen years old. My mom had bought the camera for the family but she wasn’t too fond of carrying it. Understandable as it was big and clunky. This allowed me to take as many photos as I’d like. I would take photos of anything I could. I studied tirelessly online and learned about the concepts of photography and capturing the light, or lack thereof, that I had in front of me. Then years later, and with a lot more experience, I went to Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made my way to Europe for a number of planned stops: London, Prague, Stockholm, and a small town in Germany named Bad Ems. While in London I knew I would be able to find the camera I had been waiting so long for. I found a shop that had the last Sony Alpha A7 Mark 1 in stock and I bought it. I took many photos testing out the capabilities of my new device. After London I was on my way to Prague. Here I was able to find the lens I had always wanted in a small and very interesting camera shop. They had the Tamron 28-70mm f/2.8, the lens I had always wanted to accompany the Sony Alpha A7.

          When I had made it to Europe safely I knew I was going to need a camera, a better camera. I knew which model I wanted and all I needed to do was find it. So I went online and found which of the camera shops in London had the Sony Alpha A7 Mark 1 in stock, and I found it. I trekked my way to the camera shop in the rain to make sure I could secure the last available Alpha A7 in stock in London. Finally, it was mine. I bought it with its standard lens (one I knew I would be upgrading soon) and an SD card and went to town taking as many photos as I could of everything around me.

                Traveling to Prague, Czech Republic was an amazing journey.
                The views there were stunning and unlinke anything I have
                seen here in the United States.

                One of my favorite photos of all-time, my Tiger photo, was
                actually taken through glass at my local zoo. You do not
                need to travel to be able to get interesting photos.

                Headed out to Split Rock Quarry for some photos with
                my girlfriend, Hannah, as my model. An awesome time 
                and I am very proud of the photos from the shoot.

                We made our way back out to Split Rock Quarry with
                another goal in mind: film style shots. We definitely
                delivered. Finished the photos in a 35mm film style,
                primarily black and white.
