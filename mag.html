          Let me clarify, I did not go viral or get famous from this, the title may be a little misleading. However, I did make it into a photography exhibition at the Valid World Hall in Barcelona, Spain and that is exciting enough for me. It was all possible because I finally put myself, and my photos, out there; something I have put off for a long time due to fear of rejection from the community. This is the short and somewhat uneventful story of my first time entering a photography contest online.
        </p>
        <p>
          I made my way to Europe for a number of planned stops: London, Prague, Stockholm, and a small town in Germany named Bad Ems. While in London I knew I would be able to find the camera I had been waiting so long for. I found a shop that had the last Sony Alpha A7 Mark 1 in stock and I bought it. I took many photos testing out the capabilities of my new device.

          After London I was on my way to Prague. It was there that I was able to find the lens I had always wanted in a small and very interesting camera shop. The shop had the Tamron 28-70mm f/2.8, a lens I had always wanted to accompany my Sony Alpha A7.
        </p>
        <p>
          The photo seen below is one of my personal favorites of my collection. It was taken at Split Rock Quarry in New York while trying my first full black and white shoot. I knew it was not the best photo I've ever seen, or maybe even the best I have taken, but I love it. It also got a lot of praise from friends and family, my only audience at that point.

          After a few more shoots and gaining more confidence in my work, I decided to enter some competitions. I found a website where I could enter competitions judged by the community of photographers who have also entered photos, while also partially judged by long-time known photographers in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instantly I started getting many votes. I watched tirelessly as I was gaining votes and progressing through the ranks quicker than others. That was the moment I knew I had something. The first competition I entered was four photo entries under the category Single Subject and had around fifteen days left when I entered. It also was a competition for one of one thousand spots in an exhibition in Barcelona. By the next day when I had logged into the app, three of my photos had climbed all the way into the top 1000 photos, a milestone I was pleased with, as it would get me into the exhibition. Over the fifteen days I had reached top 600 but by the end had landed just over 1000th position for my top photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was nervous, thinking I had not made the mark to be accepted into the exhibition. Three days go by after the compeition has ended and I have not heard from the competition team about my photo. Finally, I got the message. My photo would be featured. The exhibition is set for March 24th, 2022; a little over a month from now. Regardless of the fact that it is not much, and probably will not bring my work much exposure, it was a milestone for me. To know that of all of the photos entered from artists worldwide, mine would be displayed. One photo of relatively few, and it came from me.

                Traveling to London and Prague was an amazing journey.
                The views there were stunning and unlinke anything I have
                seen here in the United States.

                One of my favorite photos of all-time, my Tiger photo, was
                actually taken through glass at my local zoo. You do not
                need to travel to be able to get interesting photos.

                My first photoshoot of my girlfriend, Hannah. We decided
                the perfect location would be Split Rock Quarry since it
                is massive and has many photo opportunities.

                I headed back out to Split Rock Quarry for some photos
                with my girlfriend, Hannah, as my model. I was interested
                in shooting exclusively black and white and had an awesome
                time. I am very proud of the photos from this shoot.

                If you can not tell, Split Rock Quarry is a favorite
                location of ours to shoot at. Though this time, we had
                another goal in mind: film style shots. And we definitely
                delivered. Finished the photos in a 35mm film style,
                primarily black and white.
